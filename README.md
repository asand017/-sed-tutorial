###1. sed
*sed* (standing for a {**s**}tream {**ed**}itor) is a quick and efficient way of changing the text inside of a file without having to go in and change things yourself (time you can better use working on the next assignment :wink:).

The usual format of the sed command is as follows:

<blockquote>
sed *OPTIONS*... [*SCRIPT*] [*INPUTFILE*...]
</blockquote>

With *OPTIONS* referring to a passed in flag (i.e. **-n** or **-i**),
*SCRIPT* referring to a pattern that will be used to filter the infile text,
and *INPUTFILE* referring to the filename of the file you want to modify.
